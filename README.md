# Key_Scrambler

##Scramble your keymap with the click of a button

![Alt Icon](https://github.com/BenMiller3/Key_Scrambler/blob/master/icon.png)

The GUI runs with ruby shoes, however if you do not have shoes and do not want to install them, you can simply run the python script to scramble your keys, and run the unscrambler to unscrambler them.

Enjoy!
